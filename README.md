This pure Python module produces simulated TSO data for the Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the NIRISS instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope.

### Dependencies
The following packages are needed to run `awesimsoss`:
- numpy
- batman-package
- astropy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- exoctk

### Simulating SOSS Observations

Given a 1D spectrum of a target, this module produces a 2D SOSS ramp image with the given number of groups and integrations. For example, if I want to produce 20 integrations of 5 groups each for a J=9 A0 star as seen through SOSS, my code might look like:

```python
# Imports
import numpy as np
from awesimsoss import awesim
import astropy.units as q
import astropy.constants as ac
import batman
from pkg_resources import resource_filename
star = np.genfromtxt(resource_filename('awesimsoss','files/scaled_spectrum.txt'), unpack=True)
star1D = [star[0]*q.um, (star[1]*q.W/q.m**2/q.um).to(q.erg/q.s/q.cm**2/q.AA)]

# Initialize simulation
tso = awesim.TSO(ngrps=3, nints=5, star=star1D)
            
# Run it and make a plot
tso.run_simulation()
tso.plot_frame()
```

![output](awesimsoss/img/2D_star.png "The output trace")

The 96 subarray is also supported:

```python
tso = awesim.TSO(ngrps=3, nints=5, star=star1D, subarray='SUBSTRIP96')
```

The default filter is CLEAR but you can also simulate observations with the F277W filter like so:

```python
tso = awesim.TSO(ngrps=3, nints=5, star=star1D, filt='F277W')
```

### Simulated Planetary Transits

The example above was for an isolated star though. To include a planetary transit we must additionally provide a transmission spectrum and the orbital parameters of the planet.

Here is a sample transmission spectrum generated with PANDEXO:

```python
planet_file = resource_filename('awesimsoss', '/files/WASP107b_pandexo_input_spectrum.dat')
planet1D = np.genfromtxt(planet_file, unpack=True)
````

![planet_input](awesimsoss/img/1D_planet.png "The input transmission spectrum")

And here are some parameters for our planetary system:

```python
# Simulate star with transiting exoplanet by including transmission spectrum and orbital params
params = batman.TransitParams()
params.t0 = 0.                                # time of inferior conjunction
params.per = 5.7214742                        # orbital period (days)
params.a = 0.0558*q.AU.to(ac.R_sun)*0.66      # semi-major axis (in units of stellar radii)
params.rp = 0.1                               # radius ratio for Jupiter orbiting the Sun
params.inc = 89.8                             # orbital inclination (in degrees)
params.ecc = 0.                               # eccentricity
params.w = 90.                                # longitude of periastron (in degrees)
params.limb_dark = 'quadratic'                # limb darkening profile to use
params.u = [0.1,0.1]                          # limb darkening coefficients
tmodel = batman.TransitModel(params, tso.time)
tmodel.teff = 3500                            # effective temperature of the host star
tmodel.logg = 5                               # log surface gravity of the host star
tmodel.feh = 0                                # metallicity of the host star
```

Now the code to generate a simulated planetary transit around our star might look like:

```python
tso.run_simulation(planet=planet1D, tmodel=tmodel, time_unit='seconds')
tso.plot_lightcurve(column=42)
```

We can write this to a FITS file directly ingestible by the JWST pipeline with:

```python
tso.to_fits('my_SOSS_simulation.fits')
```

<!--We can verify that the lightcurves are wavelength dependent by plotting a few different columns of the SOSS trace like so:

```python
TSO.plot_lightcurve([15,150,300])
```
